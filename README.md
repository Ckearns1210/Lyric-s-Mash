## Lyric Smash is an app collaborated through the works of Johnny, James, Thomas, and Colin

# Mission Statement
## Lyric Smash allows a user to take a set of terms that are used to create a mashup of lyrical data using Musixmatch's API

# How to use Lyric Smash

##
1. As a user, I want to be able to log in through facebook

##
2. As a user, I want to be able to create a unique mash up of song lyrics based on a few words I pick initially

##
3. As a user, I want to be able to save mashups I find funny and share them on social media platforms

##
4. As a user, I want to have my own account that displays a list of my saved mashups

##
5. As a user, I want to see the mashups displayed in a visually and aesthetically pleasing format, as well as being able to dynamically change the mashup by randomizing a word or artist to create a new mashup

## 
6. Perhaps D3 visualization can be employed to enhance the user experience
